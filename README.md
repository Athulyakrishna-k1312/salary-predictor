# 📊 Employee Salary Classification

This project uses machine learning models to predict whether an employee earns more or less than $50K/year based on census data (adult dataset). It includes preprocessing, model comparison, outlier handling, and a Streamlit web app interface for both individual and batch predictions.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source:** `adult.csv`
- **Description:** Contains demographic and employment-related attributes (age, education, occupation, etc.) used for salary prediction.
- **Target:** Whether income is `<=50K` or `>50K`.
